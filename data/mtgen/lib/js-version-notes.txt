UPDATING --------

I don't like the stupid subfolders npm/bower create so I usually just download the new version from the website, pick the stuff I want, and manually update the libraries.
Why? I hate devops/steps/complexity. If I had dozens of dependencies this way would be an issue but it's not and this keeps it simple.

CURRENT --------

tingle.js
- 20170516: replaced fancybox with this for a modal popup as it's jQuery-free
- 20210507: updated to v0.16.0

underscore-min.js - needed by backbone
- 20140713: upgraded to 1.6.0

jquery.js - needed by backbone

backbone-mins.js
- 20140713: 1.1.2: newly included (during M15) to implement MVC in js UI
	-  LOCKED to 1.1.2 as >=1.2.0 introduces bug where it incorrectly runs ProductView.events THEN .initialize()

20170301: converted /util/card data importers to native es6 (no backbone, no jquery)

string-similarity.min.js
- Used in card-data-importer.html to suggest the actual cards in case the data source was misspelled.

DEPRECATED --------

20210507: ALSO removed mdn.base64.min.js. I think when I first started converting to base64 strings for the deck export, Mozilla didn't yet support it natively so I used this polyfill.
20210507: Removed jquery.base64.min.js which was replaced with mdn.base64.min.js. The jquery version is still used by card-data-importer-tests but I haven't updated that in forever and switching should be trivial;)
20210507: Removed jquery-validation-*, also used by defunct admin draw backend.
20210507: Removed bootstrap. I hadn't updated it in forever, github was throwing security violations because of it, and it was for the old admin draw backend that I haven't rebuilt so I'll reinstall it if I need it later.

mdn.base64.min.js
- first used 20140606 on Core 2015 Set, replaced jquery.base64.min.js I think due to jQuery 2.10+ issue

jquery.base64.min.js
- I THINK once I updated to jquery 2.10+ this broke with a INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR, so I used mdn.base64.min.js from here.

jlinq.js
- used until 20140711 (during M15) when I replaced it with linq.js

linq.js
- started using on 20140711 (during M15)
- stopped using on 20140808 when it was replaced completely with Underscore (6x faster)

jquery.eventable.js
- used until 20140713 (during M15) when I replaced it with backbone.js events
